# Notes for Future

1. Start off first class by asking why they are there (they have to? they like the topic?)
2. Chapter Quizzes instead of discussion board
3. End each lecture with a review "quiz"
4. Give regression more days and reduce z-scores and such
5. Research Portfolio is one article per 'unit' that has the method discussed
  - No writing it up, just bring it to class
6. 







## Info from Robert Heaton

Found it! Turns out it was the Center for Open Science that was involved in the study, so maybe that was keeping me from getting back to wherever I found it. I originally heard about it at a Utah Library Association conference, where I think Brian Nosek was a guest speaker. The best write-up I could find was on [FiveThirtyEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/). The whole thing is good, but the impactful image is one with the heading “Same Data, Different Conclusions” (the first chart below the soccer-field illustration). It shows that most studies came to the same conclusion, but their confidence intervals and ratings of significance varied quite a bit. [The article](https://osf.io/j5v8f/) also links to their OSF workspace, including discussion of why the teams chose their different covariates and the final article. One research-team member was from BYU, so that’s cool too. (It looks like they did a follow-up project and maybe others.)

During this semester, I also came across this article about a pretty prominent case of [p-hacking](https://www.buzzfeed.com/stephaniemlee/brian-wansink-cornell-p-hacking). It’s interesting that it was such an explicit strategy for him over time. Still, I’d hesitate to call him evil or incompetent, but you have to wonder why the pressures and incentives for publishing to get tenure operated this particular way on him where (maybe?) they did not on others. It’s troubling, too, that he trained so many students to research that way too.
 
This wasn’t a new discovery, but it seemed especially pertinent after learning more about correlation this semester: https://xkcd.com/552/. I can’t imagine you’ve made it this long as a stats guy without seeing it.
